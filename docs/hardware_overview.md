# Hardware Overview

## Power / USB

The human interface to the RTK Torch is simplistic by design! There is only one button, one USB port, and three LEDs.

*RTK Torch Button and LEDs*

To turn the RTK Torch on, press and hold the power button for ~4 seconds. You will hear a short beep and all LEDs will illuminate indicating the device has powered on.

To turn off the RTK Torch, press and hold the power button for ~4 seconds. You will hear *three* short beeps and all LEDs will turn off indicating the device has powered down.

The GNSS icon will blink once per second when a GNSS fix is achieved. It will become solid when RTK Fix is achieved.

The Bluetooth icon will blink once per second while waiting for a connection. It will become solid when a device (phone, laptop, tablet, etc) is connected.

*USB Port cover and Power LED*

A USB-C connector is hidden beneath a rubber cover. The enclosure is IP67 waterproof if and only if this cover is fully closed. 

The power LED is located next to the USB cover. It is green when external power is connected. When the device is on, this LED will be solid red indicating more than 50% battery capacity remains. The red LED will blink once per second if less than 50% of the battery capacity remains.

## Enclosure

*L1/L2/L5 helical antenna*

The helical antenna is specially tuned to receive multiple GNSS frequencies including:

* GPS: L1C/A, L1C, L2P(Y), L2C, L5
* GLONASS: L1, L2
* Galileo: E1, E5a, E5b, E6
* Beidou: B1I, B2I, B3I, B1C, B2a, B2b
* QZSS: L1, L2, L5
* SBAS

Two additional antennas are included: 915MHz for intra-radio communication (LoRa capable) and 2.4GHz for Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity.

## Battery and Charging

![Front view of RTK Torch](GPS-24672-RTK-Torch-Featured2-1.jpg)

The RTK Torch includes a 7.2V 6.8Ahr 49Whr battery. This is capable of running the device for more than 25 hours under worst-case conditions.

The RTK Torch utilizes fast USB-C PD charging up to 18W. This allows a fully discharged RTK Torch to be charged to 100% in a few hours.
