The RTK Torch is the latest and greatest generation RTK product from SparkFun Electronics and is your one-stop shop for high-precision geolocation and GIS needs. We compiled our wish list and got it all: tri-band reception, tilt compensation, and a built-in LoRa radio, all protected inside a waterproof housing.

This repo houses the datasheets and technical information for the specific hardware devices inside RTK Torch. For the firmware, see [RTK Everywhere Firmware](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware). This repo also houses the Hookup Guide material.
